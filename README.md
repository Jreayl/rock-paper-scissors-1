# The Odin Project - Web Development #
## Project: Rock Paper Scissors (With GUI) ##
In this project I revisited my previous implementation of a console based Rock Paper Scissors game
and added a fully functional GUI to the game (yay!). I struggled a bit with changing the DOM through Javascript
when getting an element by its ID because I was using hashtags when it wasn't necessary: document.getElementByID("#element")
- WRONG!. Once, I figured that out I was able to finish it. There are still improvements to make in both my HTML structure
and Javascript code.

### What I've learned from this project: ###
* Adding action event listeners to HTML objects with Javascript
* How to manipulate the DOM and change HTML text using Javascript
* How to manipulate the DOM and add/remove HTML elements using Javascript
* How to add/edit inline CSS styles using Javascript
* How to enalbe/disable inputs using Javascript
